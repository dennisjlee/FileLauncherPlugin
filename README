This plugin provides a hook for Javascript to open a file on the browser's
machine using the default application, intended for use with the icenine media
center web app.
NOTE: currently this is only supported for Windows

NOTE the second: most of the files in this project are generated code. The only
interesting changes are in FileLauncherPluginAPI.{h,cpp}. Compiled binaries are
in the compiled/ directory for archival purposes.

This project is built on top of the FireBreath cross-browser plugin framework
(http://www.firebreath.org/).

For Windows, the project will build an MSI installer if you install WiX and
re-run the prep script. See
http://www.firebreath.org/display/documentation/WiX+Installer+Help for more
help.
